In this task you only need to fetch API Keys and URLs from Firebase and add them to scripts.js.

1. Open scripts.js in your favourite editor.
2. Fill out these properties:
var config = {
		  apiKey: "",
		  authDomain: "",
		  databaseURL: ""
		};

API key is Web API key found in Firebase --> Gear icon --> Project Settings
AuthDomain is the same URL used as firebase Host in lesson04
databaseURL is the same URL as above, but with https:// in front.

3. For ease, we allow everyone and everything to read values from our database. Go to Database-->Rules and change ".read": "auth != null" to ".read": true

4. Save and open index.html in your Browser.
